      <p>
        When two humans begin to bond with the intention of reproduction, the tentacle stirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not summoned by words, but by resonance:
        pheromones in the skin, micro-fluctuations in body temperature, the rhythm of breath shared between close bodies.
        Whether grown within the body or drawn in from a shared source, the tentacle responds by blooming - soft, slick, glistening with bioactive fluid.
      </p>
      <p>
        It coils gently around the pelvises and abdomens, extending tendrils to both individuals.
        These tendrils do not penetrate with force, but slip into preexisting biological interfaces - folds, ducts, and pores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once connected, the tentacle begins a series of processes:
        it samples gametes, analyzes compatibility, and stimulates hormonal release in both parties.
        The pleasure is intense, but not sexual in the traditional sense.
        It's limbic; a full-body euphoria that transcends the genital, tapping into deep neural and emotional currents.
        People describe it as "being seen by something inside out," or "like dreaming while awake, together."
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of minutes or hours, depending on the bond, the tentacle fuses the gametes, initiates cell division, and begins the formation of the embryo.
        The early stages of gestation occur within the tentacle itself - a translucent sac that pulses with warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, the tentaclette detaches, leaving behind only a biological imprint in both partners - a faint, warm echo of the experience.
