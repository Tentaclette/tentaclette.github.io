        I had a dream once about a potential time in the future where humans couldn't reproduce without an external entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my dream, that entity was a tentacle-like creature that would insert itself into all individuals having sex together.
        It collected tissue and such, and then gestated the new child (or children) inside itself.
        Kind of like tentacle hentai, but more wholesome I guess.
        It was strange, but I imagine that at this time in the future, it would be incredibly intimate and sensual.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what this site is all about.
        Writing stories and making art about what that would be like.
        Lore, erotic stories, diagrams, anatomies, etc.
